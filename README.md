# OuterWildsModScreenshotTool
An Outer Wilds mod for taking New Horizons-ready ship log and slide reel screenshots. Generates color or greyscale images at the same sizes as vanilla images.

To take screenshots, configure the shortcut key and other settings in the mod's config menu (Pause menu -> Mods -> Screenshot Tool), then press the screenshot key at any time. Screenshots can then be found in the mod's folder, accessible from the mod manager (Installed Mods -> Screenshot Tool -> More -> Open Folder -> Screenshots).
